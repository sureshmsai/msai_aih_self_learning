# Emergency Visits Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository is dedicated to predicting emergency visits using machine learning techniques with the MIMIC III datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Git
- Jupyter Notebook or VSCode

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/msai_aih_self_learning.git
```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the code directory(use the correct path):

    ```bash
    cd ~/msai_aih_self_learning/src/code
    ```

2. Open the `Self_Learning_Tutorial_Code.ipynb` file in VSCode or your browser via Jupyter Notebook.

3. Ensure your environment is set to use Python 3.8 or above.

4. Run the code cells step by step to execute the tutorial.

## Note

- The MIMIC III dataset is provided by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology.
- Ensure that the data is used solely for the purposes outlined in this project.
